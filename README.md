A quick implementation of simulating monopoly board probabilities

### How to read the board output
This board starts with GO at index 0 and boardwalk at index 39. I wanted to create a special index for players who are in jail and not just visiting because the jail square (index 10) pulls double duty as "just visiting" and the jail itself. When a player lands on the jail square they don't go to jail. Thus, I wanted to make the jail index `IN_JAIL` to denote the turns that a player is in the jail portion of index 10. 

## Set up
1. You must have `numpy` installed
    - to install numpy on Ubuntu systems use `pip3` instead of `pip`
2. You must ensure that the file has execute permissions
    - Simply run `$ chmod u+x generate_prob.py`
3. Run the file. There are several optional command line arguments. Type `$ ./generate_prob.py -h` to learn more.

## FAQ
Q: *Why didn't you add command line arguments to specify two die with independent distributions?*   
A: I thought about having two die that each had their own respective probability distributions, but I decided that it would be too clunky to have a user input 12 (!) fractions into the terminal.

Q:


### TODO
- fix jail bug (delta between reported turns in jail and representation on board)
- create top 5 squares summary
- create percentages of board representation
